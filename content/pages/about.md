## About My Work

### Day job

I work full-time at the [University of Virginia](https://learningdesign.as.virginia.edu/jason-bennett) doing a mix of instructional design, instructional technology, project management, and software development. I manage two maker spaces as well as two XR labs. Our team serves the College of Arts & Sciences, UVA's largest school; I work with a very wide swath of faculty, including STEM, social sciences, humanities, and the arts. 

### Freelance

As a freelancer I do everything from curriculum design consulting to software development-- often on the same project. I enjoy learning new skills and working on challenging, meaningful projects.

### My process

I follow the process of "Backwards Design"-- meaning we start by clearly defining the learning goals and then design backwards from them. Other steps include defining and empathizing with our learner audience, understanding their various abilities, brainstorming / ideating, choosing a platform / mode, storyboarding, prototyping, and many other steps depending on the project. 

There is an important step before all those steps, though. In what I imagine as the "pre-design" phase, I try to get a sense of the instructor(s) and their professional, personal, and creative goals. Over the years I've discovered that the initial request is often not *actually* what the instructor wants to do; they might not know about other options, or might not feel confident trying what they *really* desire due to perceived risk. 

For instance, I once had an instructor come to me asking for help making their slide deck more interactive. During the initial conversation, however, I intuited that they didn't really want to use slides at all. They had always used slides and, as far as they knew, so had their colleagues, ergo they didn't know ditching slides was an option. Once we understood each other, we both were excited to forge something completely new. (See the [Liberatory Design Project]({{< relref "projects/black-power-station.md" >}}) to get a sense of how we changed that course.) 

Of course, sometimes the instructor(s) knows *exactly* what they want, in which case this initial conversation is very short! 

Either way, I find the best project for everybody (me, the instructor(s), and the learners) is one where we can get the head and the heart of the instructor(s) in as much agreement as possible. Learners know when instruction is logical and efficient, and they also feel when it is vital and authentic. When we can find the best possible option for the instructor(s), the design process is much more powerful and fun.

### A note on tools

I do not list specific tools because I consider myself generally versed in using and learning most tools. I enjoy learning them and have learned widely, so learning new ones is fairly easy at this point-- it's the same as somebody who has learned multiple world languages; tools like languages have common ancestries, and therefore similar features. Most of the tools are pretty good these days and can produce excellent results; they differ mostly in how enjoyable they are to work with.

Over the years working with instructors I've noticed that most of them do not have time nor interest to learn tools, and why should they? Their content and engagement with learners are most valuable. As a result, however, they might look for reassurance that a collaborator will be confident with the specific tool and will fill that knowledge gap in the project. Unfortunately they often end up hiring a collaborator who is *primarily* confident with the tool, and the results reveal *another* gap: the learning design.

There are some learning designers who don't work with the tools at all, but most of us do. Just as most good architects can use or learn any CAD software, most good learning designers can use or learn any software related to learning / e-learning. (Many of us can also do video editing, graphic design, programming, 3D modeling, motion graphics, illustration, etc. etc. see skills below.) I do not list specific tools because there are too many to list. Instead of focusing on specific tools, I like to start our conversations with a focus on the learning design.
