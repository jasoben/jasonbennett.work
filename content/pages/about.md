## About My Work

### Day job

I work full-time at the [University of Virginia](https://learningdesign.as.virginia.edu/jason-bennett) doing a mix of instructional design, instructional technology, project management, and software development. I manage two maker spaces as well as two XR labs. Our team serves the College of Arts & Sciences, UVA's largest school; I work with a very wide swath of faculty, including STEM, social sciences, humanities, and the arts. 

### Freelance

As a freelancer I specialize in immersive learning experience design. Learning experience design is a broad lens on instructional design that takes into account the cognitive experience, the emotional experience, the UX, and the aesthetic experience. I enjoy being a "soup to nuts" designer, who does everything from brainstorming to coding to analytics. I fundamentally love learning new skills, and appreciate when I have a great learning experience. I aim to pay those experiences forward in my work. 

### My process

I follow the process of "Backwards Design"-- meaning we start by clearly defining the learning goals and then design backwards from them. Other steps include defining and empathizing with our learner audience, understanding their various abilities, brainstorming / ideating, choosing a platform / mode, storyboarding, prototyping, and many other steps depending on the project. 

There is an important step before all those steps, though. In what I imagine as the "pre-design" phase, I try to get a sense of the instructor(s) and their professional, personal, and creative goals. Learners know when instruction is logical and efficient, and they also feel when it is vital and authentic. When we can find the best possible option for the instructor(s), the learning experience tends to resonate better with the learners, and the design process is much more powerful and fun.
