## About My Work

I work full-time at the [University of Virginia](https://learningdesign.as.virginia.edu/jason-bennett) doing a mix of instructional design, instructional technology, project management, and software development. I manage two maker spaces as well as two XR labs. Our team serves the College of Arts & Sciences, UVA's largest school; I work with a very wide swath of faculty, including STEM, social sciences, humanities, and the arts. 

As a freelancer I do everything from curriculum design consulting to interactive software development-- often on the same project. I enjoy learning new skills and working on challenging, meaningful projects.
