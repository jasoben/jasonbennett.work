## About My Work

### Day Job

I work full-time at the [University of Virginia](https://learningdesign.as.virginia.edu/jason-bennett) doing a mix of instructional design, instructional technology, project management, and software development. I manage two maker spaces as well as two XR labs. Our team serves the College of Arts & Sciences, UVA's largest school; I work with a very wide swath of faculty, including STEM, social sciences, humanities, and the arts. 

### Freelance

As a freelancer I do everything from curriculum design consulting to software development-- often on the same project. I enjoy learning new skills and working on challenging, meaningful projects.

### My process

I follow the process of "Backwards Design"-- meaning we start by clearly defining the learning goals and design backwards from them. Other steps include defining and empathizing with our learner audience, understanding their various abilities, brainstorming / ideating, choosing a platform / mode, storyboarding, prototyping, and many other steps depending on the project. 

Even before all those steps, though, in what I imagine as the "pre-design" phase, I try to get a sense of the instructor(s) and their professional, personal, and creative goals. Over the years I've discovered that the initial request is often not *actually* what the instructor wants to do; they might not know about other options, or might not feel confident trying what they *really* desire due to perceived risk. 

For instance, I once had an instructor come to me asking for help making their slide deck more interactive. During the initial conversation, however, I intuited that they didn't really want to use slides at all. They had always used slides and, as far as they knew, so had their colleagues, ergo they didn't know ditching slides was an option. (See the [Liberatory Design Project]({{< relref "projects/black-power-station.md" >}}) to get a sense of how we changed that course.) 

Of course, sometimes the instructor(s) knows *exactly* what they want, in which case this initial conversation is very short! 

Either way, I find the best project for everybody (me, the instructor(s), and the learners) is one where we can get the head and the heart of the instructor(s) in as much agreement as possible. Learners know when instruction is logical and efficient, and they also feel when it is vital and authentic. 

### A note to hiring managers (or instructors acting as hiring managers)

I see this frequently enough in job postings that I like to mention it. Good hiring managers are looking for every guarantee that their hires will do the job well; in doing so for learning design projects, however, they often make the mistake of emphasizing the tool or platform in their search criteria. I often see postings such as "need SPECIFIC E-LEARNING TOOL expert" or "we need somebody intimately familiar with SPECIFIC PLATFORM". 

There *are* times when a hiring manager really does need a tool / platform expert, in which case you want the best e-learning *developer* you can find. In *most* of these postings, though, hiring managers are looking for help with their learning design, and by putting the tool front and center they make a very common cognitive error I call the "hammer falacy": if you've used a hammer, then you can build my house. 

Any old contractor can use a hammer. Most *good* contractors, however, can easily learn new tools and processes quickly as needed to complete their work *and* they do the difficult work of listening, thinking, and contributing to the vision of what you want to build. The specific tool and/or platform will be easy to learn for anybody who has spent their career working with tools and platforms. You need a contractor who can do the difficult parts. 

Therefore I recommend listing your tool / platform as an afterthought. Don't say, "We need a Storyline expert," say, "we are most familiar with Storyline." This leaves your mind (and applicant pool) open to freelancers who are interested in your learning goals, your needs, and the underlying structure of your course, who may (or may not!) be intimately familiar with Storyline. Trust me, if I need to learn a tool, I can do it in about six hours (on my own time). Any good learning designer who also does development can do the same.

Of course, as somebody who has worked construction, I have seen first hand good contractors who *also* are SUPER impressive with their hammers, so if you can hire the unicorn freelancer who is skilled all-around, by all means do so. Don't just hire for the hammer, though. Don't make the "hammer falacy" when you hire a learning designer.
