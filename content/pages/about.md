## About My Work

### Day job

I work full-time at the [University of Virginia](https://learningdesign.as.virginia.edu/jason-bennett) doing a mix of instructional design, instructional technology, project management, and software development. I manage two maker spaces as well as two XR labs. Our team serves the College of Arts & Sciences, UVA's largest school; I work with a very wide swath of faculty, including STEM, social sciences, humanities, and the arts. 

### Freelance

As a freelancer I specialize in immersive learning experience design. Learning experience design is a broad lens on instructional design that takes into account the cognitive experience, the emotional experience, the UX, and the aesthetic experience. I enjoy being a "soup to nuts" designer, who does everything from brainstorming to coding to analytics. I fundamentally love learning new skills, and appreciate when I have a great learning experience. I aim to pay those experiences forward in my work. I am able to speak the language of educators and developers, and ensure successful projects. 

I primarily work in and know Unity, but am comfortable in Unreal. In my personal game design I am increasingly using Godot, which I hope will continue on its trajectory to become fully immersive capable.
