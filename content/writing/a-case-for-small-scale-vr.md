When imagining learning objectives for VR apps, educators tend to think big. 

"Students can explore the whole universe!"

"They'll live in history!"

"It'll be like Magic School Bus, but in VR!"

VR tends to inspire these flights of imagination because, well, that's what tech companies promise us. Also: it is *technically* possible to do all the things I just had hypothetical educators imagine. The catch, of course, is that developing for VR takes lots of time, money, and skill. Even in the best circumstances, with huge grants and talented people, it can be hard to produce a VR app that does anything more than wow students for a few minutes. If we're lucky, they *might* learn what we hope them to learn, but often the novelty of VR works against learning objectives, not with them. 

Like many technologies, VR was both worthy of the hype and dramatically over-hyped to pump up investments.
