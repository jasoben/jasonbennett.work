Working over multiple years with faculty and students we developed a pilot of a college-level economics course taught entirely in virtual reality. We used the Rec Room metaverse app as the platform, with students using Meta Quest 2 headsets.

Students welcomed a change from Zoom school (this project started during the pandemic), and found the ability to "move around" data helpful to understand economics concepts visualized in 3D.

## My process

I embedded in the class for two years as an instructional designer. I also built many of the learning environments and helped with technical problems.
