A collaborative group of physicists representing multiple universities and organizations wanted to show their research on proton "photography" (as such) in a captivating way both to fellow physicists and non-physicists. Via conversations and design sessions, we settled on a virtual museum using the Meta Quest 2, with the primary exhibit showing a "behind the electron" view of how a particle accelerator creates data about protons via collisions.

## My process

I ran brainstorming & design sessions with content experts, storyboarded the exhibits and interactions, modeled all assets, built the app in Unity, and successfully delivered the app for use at multiple physics conferences. 

## Target audience

Working physicists as well as interested non-physicists
