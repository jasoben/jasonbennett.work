An open-source module for middle school students learning electrical and mechanical engineering. The goal was to create a working DC motor project that could be done for much less than the typical cost of kits. The materials needed to build the Papercraft DC Motor cost about $1.50 per kit, compared to $10-20 for typical kits, and could be purchased at any big-box Home Supply store.

The kit has been successfully used in multiple middle schools. 

## My process

I came up with the idea, designed the die-cut frame as well as optional 3D print accessories, tested and iterated to make a working kit, wrote the content and assessments for the unit as well as created video and animation resources to accompany them.
