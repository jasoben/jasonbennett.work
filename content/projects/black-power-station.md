description: "Using Liberatory Design as a framework for project-based learning in an undergrad Music course"
---

Working over multiple years closely with faculty, grad students, and undergrads, we developed a semester-long project-based course that has undergraduate students collaborating with artists from The Black Power Station-- an arts collective in Makhanda, South Africa. 

The student projects combine skills in design thinking (using the Liberatory Design framework and card deck), project management, deep listening, creative collaboration, event planning, and international diplomacy. Students made use of digital whiteboard tools, ePortfolios, design thinking exercises, mindfulness-based pedagogy, contract grading, makerspaces, media production, and traditional scholarship. 

## My process

I embedded in the class for two years and served as a quasi co-instructor while also working closely with faculty, grad students, and undergrads to design the course learning goals, activities, assessments, technology supports, and various other aspects.
