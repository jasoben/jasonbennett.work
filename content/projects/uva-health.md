The UVA Health System needed help creating their immersive med-student training prototype for the central line placement procedure (a common medical procedure). The project successfully demonstrated the potential of 360 video as a tool for distraction-free, immersive learning. Students remarked that the prototype helped them focus, practice choosing the right tool in the sequence, and feel a connection with the instructor. Compared to the 2D version (developed concurrently), students found the immersive experience reduced cognitive load and distractions while also giving them an "over the doctor's shoulder" experience.

## My process

I ran design thinking sessions with content experts, designed the module, created storyboards for the video, directed the video, built the module in Unity (including the data-collection backend), designed user testing and assessments, analyzed data, and delivered the product on time and on budget.
